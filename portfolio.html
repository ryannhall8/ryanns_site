<h2>A few things I have built</h2>
<h3>(I just started coding with this bootcamp, so my portfolio doesnt have a lot right now, but I hope to add more soon!)</h3>

<div>
    <img src="zoo.png">
    <p2>This was my very first project using code. I make a website describing zoo animals. On this 
        website I provided pictures for each animal and a link to where you can find out more about each one.</p2>
</div>

<div>
    <img src="grocery.png">
    <p2>This was my second project. I made a grocery list the same way I listed the animals in
        the zoo project. This time I added css to make it more organized and better to look at.</p2>
