# ryanns_site
This is a personal site all about me. one page one is really just an introduction with just an image, my name, and a quote that I like. Page 2 is all about me and my work, 
who I spend time with, my school, and some of my hobbies. The last page, the portfolio page, is just a couple projects that I have done regarding code.

h1 "My Site" on all three pages

index.html-
lines 9-13 are creating the nav bar and the selected home is so i can style it in css and make it bigger so its obvious which page you are on.
line 15 is just a header that displays my name
and line 19 is a header3 tag that displays a quote I like a bit smaller than the header1

about.hmtl-
The lines 9-12 are creating the nav bar while the class singles out the about button so i could make it bigger in css
line 15 is a header tag so "A Little About me" stands out
lines 17-40 are different sections so I could seperate each differnt thing about me I was writing about. for example me, work, and hobbies.

portfolio.html-
line 13 and about are the same as the other html pages
h2 and h3 are things I want to have a header with just h3 being a bit smaller
the two divs describe my two projects with an image inside each one along with a descrption

style.css-
nav a.selected - makes it so every class that = selecteds font size will change when clicked on
nav - adds a border with padding around the text and made the box a pink shade
section- makes each section have a border and a background color and a differnt font. items aligned in the center makes it so the texts says centered in the box
and overflow makes it so the text stays within the border.
h3- just wanted to add padding around the h3
img- changed the height to make it the size i needed for my pages
div- added a border to the portfolio pages boxes and made it have space around
body- make the background color a lighter pink

javascript.js-
A "Hello world" tier Javascript routine
